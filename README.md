# Repository for the paper titled "Evolutionary effects of individual variation and higher-order interactions on robustness of species coexistence."

### This repository contains the following R and C++ scripts, and data used for producing the figures


#### Data: 
`data.rds`, `data_fig1.rds`, `data_processesd.rds` are used to produce all the figures used in the main-text

#### R and C++ scripts:

`models.cpp` is the script that details all the models used in the main-text.
`plotFig1.R` plots the figure 1 using `data_fig1.rds`.
`plots.R` does all the other plots in the main-text.
`processData.R` does structure the data from the models.
`simulate.R` includes a bunch of functions for plottin and organises for numerically solving the models.
